# Connect-Four-Game
This was My first Full-Stack project, an online rendition of the classic game “Connect Four”. There are several improvements to the base game including user onboarding, authentication, and password encryption such that you can keep track of your games and add friends. There is also an in-game chatbox to talk with your opponent while you play. This was my first experience with data encryption and multiplayer functionality across more than one device. Overall, a fun introduction to Full-Stack development which taught me that jumping into a project will drastically improve your design skills compared with traditional learning in classes at university. This project tested and led to improvements in my interface design and SCC skills more than anything else.
